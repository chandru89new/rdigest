- I havent decided on a name for this project yet.
- This is supposed to be (at the time of writing this) a tool to create "daily digest" for me to read/catch up on from RSS feeds that I add into the system. It may morph into something else as I keep building/working on it.
- It's a project concocted to learn and build things in Haskell.
- I am [journaling it on my dev blog](https://code.druchan.com) (look for posts titled `Haskell Journal - Day ..`).

**Todos**:

- [x] group daily digest by source. should it be feed source? -- using feed url for now beacuse i dont save the "title" of the feed.
- [ ] start a server to show daily digest instead of creating a file
- [ ] app throw `bus error` sometimes. find out why
